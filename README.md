# :tennis: mybigpoint-lk-widget
 
 This widget shows your current mybigpoint LK.
 
## Widget Design and Functionality
<img src="./img/widget.jpg" align="left" width="170" height="170">
The widget shows your name and the year you were born in at the top. At the bottom your current mybigpoint LK is displayed.</br>
The data is received from the following web page: [WTB-Tennis] (https://www.wtb-tennis.de/spielbetrieb/vereine.html). Therefore you must be a member of a club listed there. This is also the page where you can find your club's ID, which is a required configuration parameter. In addition, you need to know your own ID-Number. See [Setup] (https://github.com/jkling2/mybigpoint-lk#setup) for further information on how to specify these configuration parameter.
